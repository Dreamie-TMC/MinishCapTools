# MinishCapTools
A series of tools for Minish Cap Speedruns and Practice

## Developers
#### Straylite
- Created the input viewer
#### Dreamie

## Contributors
#### Myth
- Testing, ideas, helping with some of the science behind the tools
#### LeonarthCG, WJG999, PPLToast
- Documented memory addresses and flags for TMC which allows these tools to be possible
#### Testers
- NyanCato
- Aridner

## Current Tools
#### Input Viewer
- Straylite's input viewer for BizHawk, modified for compatability
- All credits for input viewer designs and code go to Straylite
#### Textbox Mash Trainer
- Shows what percentage of text drawing frames you were holding "B" for
- Shows what percentage of text boxes you closed frame perfectly or not
- Shows the total amount of frames lost to perfect textboxes

## How To Use
#### Input Viewer
- K loads the default positions for the input viewer
- U unlocks the input viewer allowing you to move it anywhere on screen
- B adds a bold line around the inputs to make them pop
- V uses a custom color (set in colors.txt) for the button presses instead of the defaults

#### Textbox Mash Trainer
- T hides the output from the trainer
- R resets the counters for the trainer


#### Shared
- M loads movie mode allowing inputs to be displayed for recordings and shows how well the movie mashes textboxes
- C changes the background of the extension from black to blue or vice-versa

## Future Plans
#### Loading/Editing Keybinds from a configuration file
#### Disabling certain features from running through keybinds to improve performance
#### Editing Keybinds directly in the UI
#### Total Lost Frames doing actions (pulling, shrinking)
#### Frames between rolls counter, also counting the number of frame perfect rolls
#### Useful Practice Tools such as Boss HP
#### Integration of Straylite's Pseudo Practice Rom LUA
